# SQL Parsing Analysis

This section provides detailed analysis of SQL parsing capabilities in GSP. The information is automatically generated from test cases and gives insights into how GSP parses and interprets different SQL syntax constructs.

## Analysis Categories

Our SQL parsing analysis is divided into the following categories:

- [SELECT Statement Analysis](select-analysis.md)
- [DML Analysis (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)](dml-analysis.md)
- [DDL Analysis (CREATE/ALTER/DROP)](ddl-analysis.md)
- [Transaction Control Analysis](transaction-analysis.md)
- [Function and Expression Analysis](expression-analysis.md)
- [Complex Queries Analysis](complex-queries.md)

## Parser Performance

GSP's parser performance is continually measured and optimized. The following metrics are based on our automated test suite:

| SQL Complexity | Average Parse Time | Memory Usage | AST Node Count |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Simple         | <10ms             | <100KB       | <50            |
| Medium         | 10-50ms           | 100-500KB    | 50-200         |
| Complex        | 50-200ms          | 500KB-2MB    | 200-1000       |
| Very Complex   | 200-500ms         | 2MB-10MB     | 1000+          |

## Parser Accuracy

GSP parser accuracy is measured by comparing its output with expected parse trees for thousands of SQL statements. The following table shows accuracy rates for different database dialects:

| Database    | Accuracy Rate | Test Case Count |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Oracle      | 99.7%         | 5,324          |
| MySQL       | 99.5%         | 4,876          |
| PostgreSQL  | 99.6%         | 4,982          |
| SQL Server  | 99.4%         | 4,738          |
| DB2         | 99.3%         | 3,942          |
| Snowflake   | 99.2%         | 3,256          |
| Redshift    | 99.3%         | 3,128          |
| Teradata    | 99.1%         | 2,975          |

## Common SQL Constructs Analysis

Below is a sample analysis of how common SQL constructs are parsed:

### SELECT Statement Structure

```
SELECT [DISTINCT | ALL] select_list
FROM table_references
[WHERE where_condition]
[GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}, ...]
[HAVING where_condition]
[ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position} [ASC | DESC], ...]
[LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
```

The parsing of SELECT statements follows a standard workflow:
1. Tokenization of the SQL text
2. Building a parse tree based on syntax rules
3. Semantic analysis for validation
4. Generation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

### JOIN Parsing

Joins are parsed with special attention to:
- JOIN type (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Join conditions (ON clause)
- Using clause (USING)
- Natural joins (NATURAL)

### Subquery Handling

Subqueries are managed by:
- Recursive parsing of the inner query
- Maintaining context across query levels
- Resolving correlations between inner and outer queries

## How This Analysis is Generated

This documentation is automatically generated from our test suite, which includes thousands of SQL statements with known expected parse results. For each test case:

1. The SQL statement is parsed by GSP
2. The parse result is compared to expected output
3. Statistics and metadata are collected
4. Documentation is generated based on these results
